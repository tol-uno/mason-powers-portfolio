					<h2>I tackle both the artistic and the technical side of creating media</h2>

						One of my greatest strengths is being a bridge between these two sides of a problem. My technical side comes from my background in coding and 3D development.

						I wouldn't drink that seltzer -- it's five times your daily recommended dose of cholesterol.

					<h2>I'm constantly teaching myself new 3D techniques and software</h2>

						This image was an early concept created for The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia. Our team's task was to increase museum engagement through technology. We developed scannable trading cards and AR filters that tied into exhibits.
						<br><br>
						I created the next three automotive renders as backgrounds to promote events and ecommerce sales on social media. (But they also make pretty sleek wallpapers)

					<h2>I have formal training and background in Product Design</h2>
					<p>
						The broad nature of this discipline means it has applications within nearly everything I create nowadays.
						<br><br>
						It also means I am familiar with the entire design process, from brainstorming to manufacturing and marketing.
						<br><br>
						In this project I designed a whisk that minimized discomfort for users with wrist pain or injury.

					<h2>I use 3D software to create dynamic and lively animations.</h2>
					<p>
						This personal project uses my headset model from earlier. It was one of my first more ambitious animation projects. It taught me a lot about camera work and movement.
						<br><br>
						Looking back at this video, you can definitely see places where the camera's easing motion needs refinement.

						I created this intro/outro graphic for Fabspeed's YouTube videos. I learned to convey information and ideas within a very limited time constraint.

					<h2>I created and rendered this video in 12 hours</h2>

					<h2>VFX compositing and simulation showcase</h2>
					<p>
						To create this shot I modeled a 3D version of the room to run the fluid simulation in.
						<br><br>
						I utilized the perspective matching program fSpy to get the camera's position and field of view in 3D space.
						<br><br>
						The video was projected onto the 3D walls, allowing the goo to refract the textures.
						<br><br>
						To improve this shot I would cast an amber glow onto the nearby walls as the goo fills the room
