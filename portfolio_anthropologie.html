				<h2>I'm excited about this Motion Graphic Designer role because it incorporates a variety of my

					These are some animations I've created: This first one was a personal project made to show off my VR
					headset model (image to the right). It taught me a lot about camera work within a 3D environment.
					<br><br>
					The second video is an intro/outro graphic I created for social media. I learned how to quickly
					convey information and ideas with this video. I am responsible for all sound and visuals in both
					these videos.

				<h2>Alongside 3D motion graphics, I do lots of static graphic design and marketing material</h2>
				<p>
					One of my greatest strengths is being a bridge between the artistic side and the technical side of

					<br><br>
					Below are web banners that showcase more rendering, graphic design, and user interface work. These
					two banners are some of my favorite 3D work I've done.

					By the way, I wouldn't drink that seltzer -- it's three times your daily recommended dose of

				<h2>Website Design and Development</h2>
				<p>
					The project to the right is a website I built for the Drexel Product Design Graduating Class of
					2023.
					<br><br>
					I led the web team in creating a site that gave information about the Thesis Show and brief
					introductions to the projects and designers.
					<br><br>
					This is a fully responsive web page entirely hand coded by myself in HTML, CSS, and JS. The homepage
					has some fun motion graphics in the background that I'd recommend checking out.

					My single most valuable skill is learning. I love learning, and I've become very efficient at

					By far the most exciting thing about Anthropologie for me is the opportunity to learn more.

				<h2>App and Game Development</h2>
				<p>
					I recently started development on my second mobile game. I'm writing the game and engine from
					scratch in JavaScript and plan to release it on iOS and Android.
					<br><br>
					I've been making games as a hobby since middle school -- it's what got me into coding. I've worked
					in many different game engines, on many different games -- 2D, 3D, and VR.
					<br><br>
					Game design has taught me the most out of all my creative endeavors. Right now, it's teaching me how
					to manage a larger project than I've ever had to manage before.
